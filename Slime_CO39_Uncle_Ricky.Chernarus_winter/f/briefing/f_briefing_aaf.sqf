Shit has gone to hell. We've been found out by the local government. We had to abandon our safehouse in Berezino. Fortunately we managed to burn or escape with everything particularly incriminating but I'd bet Washington is on fire 
about this either way. Fortunately there's an old army outpost at Black Lake that nobody else was using, so we've holed up there. Our last thing before destroying the equipment was to send out an emergency broadcast to any nearby friendlies about our 
predicament; all we can do is shoot anything not flying an American flag until someone that is shows up to get us out of here.
