We have been quickly deployed to a post-Soviet state in order to assist in the extraction of a CIA cell that has been exposed. We touched down with no fuel left in the southwest of the province, while last we heard, they were in the northeast. We will need to find some fuel for the helicopter so that we can rescue them from whatever shit they're in.
