Yes the ARs are just rifles with 100rd mags and bipods. MG36MLIs don't exist in the modpack so we gotta deal. Puma only having AP cannon is to avoid it being OP, it should still have the coax and the ATGMs.

<br/>
An unknown enemy force has occupied significant regions of the Celle region without any declaration of war. Nobody recognizes their patches,a nd their camo patterns are completely unknown as well. For now they are being considered a terrorist group with capabilities on the level of the armed forces of a first-world nation. Our mission is complete destruction of their forces.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
Unknown terrorist group with significant armored support and infantry strength. Initial intelligence points to one infantry company and approximately 3 armored vehicles present in the three objective towns. Heavy armor has been spotted in Winsen-Aller so it is HIGHLY recommended that you avoid approaching that area without air or heavy armor support. For now just take hold of the 3 marked towns.
